PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  
--------------------------
** Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia				Aug. 2008-present
   Research Assistant
   [ Social Decision Networks in Software Engineering ]
     - Proposed and developed a model of Social Decision Networks (SDNs) which formalizes how people in social networks perform collaborative decision making in software development. 
     - Developed Web 2.0 based web services to support distributed social construction of SDNs and inference of coordination requirements of social networks for software quality improvement.
     - Part of IBM Open Collaborative Research program.
     - Technology used: RESTful web service, Javascript+Ajax (Dojo), Comet, Non-SQL database.
   
   [ Grounding Socio-Technical Congruence in a Decision-Based Ontology ]
     - Developed and recast theories of Socio-Technical Congruence in software ecosystems in terms of design decisions and dependencies.
     - Based on STC theories, developed organization coordination analytics on top of IBM Rational Jazz platform.
     - Technology used: IBM Rational Jazz platform, Eclipse Plug-in Development, Eclipse Modeling Framework.
   
   [ Wireless Sensors based Load Monitoring and Energy Conservation ]
     - Proposed a wireless sensors based framework which monitors and reduces residential energy expenditure by monitoring and predicting occupancy patterns.
     - Technology used: Matlab, data mining.

   [ Sieve: Simple Event Classification for Wireless Sensor Networks ]
     - Proposed a system called Sieve that uses unsupervised learning to automatically identify recurring events in sensor streams.
     - Compared Sieve to conventional supervised learning and analyzed performance in terms of accuracy and systems scalability to multiple deployment scenarios.
     - Technology used: Matlab, decision tree, Bayes classification, k-means, principal component analysis.

** IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, New York				May 2010-Aug. 2010
   Research Intern
   [ Supporting Enterprise Stakeholders' Collaboration using Decision Space ]
     - Studied the enterprise coordination patterns and state-of-art supporting facilities by interviewing a variety of technical and non-technical personnel.
     - Designed and developed a framework that provides supports for enterprise stakeholders' collaboration and coordination in software development process in the ontology of decision space.
     - Technology used: Restlet, Javascript+Ajax (Dojo), J2EE.

** Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University				Sep. 2006-Jun. 2008
   Research Assistant
   [ Motion Time Series Classification ]
     - Proposed a classification model for multivariate motion time series, with application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to feature extraction and model training.
     - Conducted experiments to test the model performance and compare it with the state-of-art techniques.
     - Technology used: decision tree, neural networks, numerical analysis.

** Selected Projects in Master Program
   - Software Engineering. Developed a mobile application on Android platform that connects phone users to Weichi contest on KGS Go server and provides them intelligent move recommendation.
