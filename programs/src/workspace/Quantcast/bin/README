Quantcast Coding Exercise:  Spreadsheet Calculator

Your job is to modify SpreadSheet.java to implement the description
given in that class.

For your convenience, tests are included.  You may just run them using
run.sh, or, if you want to use the real JUnit and have it installed, you
would just un-comment the import directive at the beginning of
TestSpreadSheet.java.

Good luck!
